        <p>Kanye West is a rapper and producer who came out of Chicago. He is considered a musical genius and rightly so. He is known to be married to Kim Kardashian who he had four children with. Kanye is definitely one of my favorite of all time. He is diagnosed bipolar and has had to deal with his mental health over the years. Spme of his popular tracks include Stronger, Heartless, and Gold Digger. Below there is a link to five of my favorite Kanye West songs.</p>
